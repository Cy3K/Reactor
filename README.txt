A new standard of encryption has arrived; the best part is that it's free to use. The entire point of this software is to allow people to implement advanced encryption/security layers to websites, games, apps, and other miscellaneous creations with the ease of only having to copy and paste. But, for the people that prefer to crack open an energy drink and work their fingers to the bone like I do, there is also a FULLY documented API that can be used with nearly any programming language on a web-connected device.
